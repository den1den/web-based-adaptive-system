<h2>Welcome to GALE</h2>

<p>
Thank you for your interest in GALE as your adaptive Web-based system.
You are now viewing the main starting page of the GALE distribution.
From this page you can go to the following sub-parts:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Learn more about GALE and its role within <a href="http://www.grapple-project.org" target="_blank">GRAPPLE</a>
through the <a href="concept/gale://gale.tue.nl/course/grapple/GALE">tutorial</a>.
</li>
<li>
Applications installed through external authoring tools (like the 
<a href="http://www.grapple-project.org/software" target="_blank">Grapple Authoring Tools</a>) can be accessed
<a href="concept/gale://gale.tue.nl/admin/courselist">here</a>. To view an example, you
can visit the <a href="concept/gale://gale.tue.nl/course/milkyway/Milkyway">Milkyway</a> application.
</li>
<li>
There is also an old version of the
<a href="concept/gale://gale.tue.nl/aha3/tutorial/welcome">AHA! 3 tutorial</a>. Its
contents no longer describes the current state of GALE as an adaptive system. It is
only provided as an example of an adaptive application.
</li>
<li>
The <a href="concept/gale://gale.tue.nl/admin/AMt">Application Management Tool</a>
lets you transfer files from your local machine to the server and back. Some old
AHA! 3 authoring tools are still available as well.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you are new to GALE, have not yet installed it, and are not
using it on an existing GALE server, you can start learning about
GALE from the publications on the main
<a href="http://gale.win.tue.nl/" target="_blank">GALE website</a>.
</p>

<p>To (download and) install GALE yourself you should first
go over the "readme" file, included below. These steps include installing a
Java environment and the (Java-based) Tomcat webserver,
not available for download from the GALE website (for legal and
maintenance reasons).

<h2>Installation Notes</h2>
These notes are taken from the <em>readme</em> file.<br>

---------------------------------------
    Gale Installation Instructions
---------------------------------------

1. Software requirements

To run Gale you will need the following:
  - JDK 6 (http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp)
  - Maven 2 (http://maven.apache.org/download.html)
  - Tomcat 6 (don't use the Windows installer) (http://tomcat.apache.org/download-60.cgi)
  - MySQL 5.1 (Essentials) (http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.1.html#downloads)

(note: JDK 5 will work as well)

2. Installation

We recommend creating a directory structure for gale that has the following layout:
  /gale
    /gale-source
    /jdk
    /maven
    /mysql
    /tomcat

Unpack/install all archives in their respective directories and create an environment
script file to setup your Gale environment. In Windows this would be a batch file (a text
file with extension .bat or .cmd) and might look like:

@echo off
set "PACKAGE_HOME=C:\gale"
rem java
set "JAVA_HOME=%PACKAGE_HOME%\jdk"
set "path=%JAVA_HOME%\bin;%PATH%"
rem tomcat
set "CATALINA_HOME=%PACKAGE_HOME%\tomcat"
set "path=%CATALINA_HOME%\bin;%PATH%"
rem maven
set "MAVEN2_HOME=%PACKAGE_HOME%\maven"
set "path=%MAVEN2_HOME%\bin;%PATH%"
rem mysql
set "MYSQL_HOME=%PACKAGE_HOME%\mysql"
set "path=%MYSQL_HOME%\bin;%PATH%"

Download the Gale source from svn (https://svn.win.tue.nl/repos/gale/trunk) to your local
gale-source directory.

3. Setup

Run the script to ensure a proper environment.

Start and setup MySQL:
  - go to '/gale/gale-source' directory.
  - run (in Windows) 'start mysqld --standalone --console'
  - run 'mysql -u root < gale.sql'

The following steps will install GALE if you are not going to use eclipse to develop with
GALE. You can skip these steps if you use eclipse.

Go to your '/gale/gale-source/master' directory and run 'mvn install'.

Copy '/gale/gale-source/gale/target/gale.war' to your '/gale/tomcat/webapps' directory
and start Tomcat by running 'startup'.

4. Development

We recommend using eclipse (http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) to develop with Gale. Run
'mvn eclipse:eclipse -Dwtpversion=2.0' in your '/gale/gale-source/master' directory to
setup the project for use in eclipse.

Additional plugins (like maven and subversion for eclipse), can be installed by adding
update sites to eclipse and installing plugins. Proceed as follows:
  - maven, update site 'http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/update-dev/', select
    'Maven Integration' (tree), 'Maven Central repository index' and
    'Maven Integration for WTP'
  - subclipse, update site 'http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.6.x',
    select 'subclipse'

To install plugins, go to 'Help', 'Software Updates...', select the tab 'Available
Software', and add the update site there.

To import the gale projects, choose 'Import...' from the 'File' menu, select 'General',
'Maven projects', and browse to '/gale/gale-source'.
