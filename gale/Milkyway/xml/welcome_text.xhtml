This adaptive application examplifies the use of the Template-based approach for authoring in GALE. <br />
Although this application looks like any other adaptive application, the contrary is true.<br />
The pages of this application are all based on templates. The templates contain <i>references to attributes </i> that express the URLs of the resources that contain the title, image and the text, rather than the hardcoded URLs that are usually encountered in pages of adaptive applications.<br />
Furthermore, the labels that you will see on the following pages are all properties of attributes, e.g. the label 'Information: ' is  property of the attribute that holds the information-resource.<br />
