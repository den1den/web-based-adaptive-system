Ganymede is a natural satellite of Jupiter and the largest natural satellite in the Solar System. Completing an orbit in roughly seven days, it is the seventh satellite and third Galilean satellite from Jupiter.[9] Ganymede participates in a 1:2:4 orbital resonance with the satellites Europa and Io, respectively. It is larger in diameter than the planet Mercury but has only about half its mass.[10]
