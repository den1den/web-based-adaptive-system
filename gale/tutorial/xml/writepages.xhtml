<h2>Write Pages</h2>
<p>The application in itself not only constitutes of the conceptual
structure, but also pages written in a specific language which represent
the various <gale:a href="concepts">concepts</gale:a> used.</p>
<p>A model set of pages is created for your reference. The AHA!
distribution contains a directory "example" with a set of pages to be
used for the example application. These pages are actually in HTML, not
XHTML, but AHA! automatically converts HTML to XHTML in order to be able
to process it.</p>
<p>For further reference on how to create pages check out the <gale:a
	href="pages">page format</gale:a> section of the tutorial.</p>
