<h3>Further explanation</h3>
<p>The concept structure can be created using the high level <gale:a
	href="graphauthor">graph author tool</gale:a>, the low level <gale:a
	href="concepteditor">concept editor</gale:a> or by directly editing the
XML file that contains the application's concept structure. In order to
create the conceptual structure of the <gale:a href="domainmodel">domain model</gale:a>
we recommend that you use the <gale:a href="graphauthor">graph
author tool</gale:a>. Advanced authors may wish to have a look at the low level <gale:a
	href="concepteditor">concept editor</gale:a> which allows complete
control over the adaptive behavior of AHA!, but which is much more
difficult to use.</p>
<h4>Templates</h4>
<ul>
	<li>A <em>page concept</em> represents a single page and has an
	associated resource and a <em>knowledge update</em> relationship with
	itself to indicate that there is a knowledge increase associated with
	the page access.</li>
	<li>A <em>container page concept</em> is a composite concept of
	which that has an associated page and of which all the children are
	either pages or container page concepts.</li>
	<li>An <em>abstract concept</em> does not have a resource or
	knowledge update relationship but is used to group concepts in the
	concept hierarchy. (It is like a container page but without the page.)</li>
</ul>
