<h2>Define the Event Condition Access Rules or the Adaptation Rules</h2>

<p>To generate <gale:a href="rules">
	<gale:object name="adaptationrule" /> rules</gale:a> that define the
adaptation behavior associated with the application just save the
application, using button <img src="../images/graphsavebutton.gif"
	width="30" height="30" />. <br />
The <gale:a href="graphauthor">Graph Author Tool</gale:a> will
automatically generate two files named "example.gaf" and "example.aha".
You can see the files in the "Author Files Tab" in <a
	href="../images/amt.gif" target="_blank">AMT</a>.</p>
<p>The ".gaf" extension is what is used by the <gale:a
	href="graphauthor">Graph Author Tool</gale:a> to recreate the
graph(ical) presentation. To open an already saved aplication double
click on the ".gaf" file.</p>
<p>Commit the saved application to the running AHA! system by using
<img src="../images/graphcommitbutton.gif" width="30" height="30" />.
Only when edits are "committed" do they affect end-users that log in to
the application. You can safely edit an application and save results a
number of times. You only "commit" the application when you are
confident that the structure is right and that end-users should start
using it.</p>
