<h2>The AHA! Domain Model</h2>

<p>Each AHA! application consists of a set of <gale:a
	href="concepts">concepts</gale:a>, with associated attributes and <gale:object
	name="adaptationrule" /> <gale:a href="rules">rules</gale:a>. Most
concepts are associated with <gale:a href="pages">pages</gale:a>.</p>

<p>In order to create the conceptual structure of the domain model
we recommend that you use the <gale:a href="graphauthor">graph
author</gale:a> tool. Advanced authors may wish to have a look at the low level <gale:a
	href="concepteditor">concept editor</gale:a> which allows complete
control over the adaptive behavior of AHA!, but which is much more
difficult to use.</p>
