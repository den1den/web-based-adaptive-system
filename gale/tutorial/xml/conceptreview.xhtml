<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>A concept is an abstract entity. It can correspond to number of
things like text fragments, whole pages and even more complex
structures.<br />
There are two types of structures :</p>
<ol>
	<li>Atomic Concepts : Text fragments are termed as atomic
	concepts.</li>
	<li>Composite Concepts : We consider two types of composite
	concepts: <strong>pages and abstract concepts.</strong> Pages are
	composites of which all the children are fragments, or atomic concepts.
	Abstract concepts are composites of which all the children are
	composite concepts (either abstract or pages).</li>
