<h2>Creating Concepts Using Graph Author Tool</h2>
<p>We will see how to make simple <gale:a href="concepts">concepts</gale:a>
using the Graph Author Tool provided with AHA!e.</p>
<p>The <gale:a href="graphauthor">Graph Author
Tool</gale:a> is the main authoring tool for the concept structure. It lets you
create a concept hierarchy and concept relationships of different types.<br />
Note: The use of <gale:a href="concepteditor">Concept
Editor Tool</gale:a> and manual editing of the XML file that contains the concept
structure is not recommended.</p>
<ol>
	<li>First you need to start the Graph Author tool. This can be
	done through the <a href="../../author/AMt/AMt.html" target="_blank">Application
	Management Tool</a> (AMT). <br />
	AMT requires you to <strong>Log In</strong> as an author first. (AHA!
	comes with a default author called "author", with password "aha". You
	then see the applications of this author.</li>
	<li>Create a new application by either using the menu toolbar or
	using the button <img src="../images/graphnewbutton.gif" width="29"
		height="29" />. We will assume that you create a new application,
	called <em>example</em>.</li>
	<li>After you created the <em>example</em> application you can
	open the application with the Graph Author. (Right click on the
	application for a menu of actions, or go to the Author files tab and
	double click on the "example.gaf" file.) After it is opened the Graph
	Author should look like in <a href="../images/graphauthor_new.gif"
		target="_blank">this screendump</a> (but the toplevel concept will be
	named "example"). <gale:if expr="${graphauthor#knowledge}==0">
		<gale:block>
			<br />
	Note: All the functions performed by the <a
				href="../images/graphauthorbuttons.gif" target="_blank">buttons</a> in the toolbar can also be achieved
	by corresponding menu items. The functions of buttons are mentioned in
	their tooltips. For further reference visit the <gale:a
				href="graphauthor">Graph Author Page</gale:a> of this tutoria </gale:block>
	</gale:if></li>
	<li>In the left of the tool you see the <a
		href="../images/graphauthor_new.gif" target="_blank">concept
	hierarchy</a>. Right click on the the concept named 'example' and click
	[Edit].<br />
	</li>
	<li>What you see now is a <a href="../images/grapheditconcept.gif"
		target="_blank">Edit Concept Dialog Box</a>. It contains the following
	fields:
	<ul>
		<li>Name : This is the name of the <gale:a href="concepts">concept</gale:a>.
		Every concept must have a unique name, which in AHA! must be a single
		word (alphanumeric and starting with a letter). It is advisable to use
		descriptive names. The first <gale:a href="concepts">concept</gale:a>
		should have the same name as that of the application. Let us name it <strong>'example'</strong></li>
		<li>Description : This corresponds to the self defined short
		description of the <gale:a href="concepts">concept.
		</gale:a>This is basically used for further usage and cross usability.</li>
		<li>Resource : This corresponds to the page written in HTML or
		XHTML which this page corresponds to. It follows a strict format<br />
		file:/name_of_the_application/relative_path_of_the_file<br />
		Let us keep this field blank as for now.</li>
		<li>Template : This drop down menu lets you select predefined <gale:a
			href="concepttemplate">concept templates</gale:a> included in AHA!.
		We select the 'abstract concept' template. <br />
		Note: The abstract concepts don't have any resources.</li>
	</ul>
	After the completion of above steps the Edit Concept Dialog Box looks
	like this <a href="../images/grapheditconcept_filled.gif"
		target="_blank">screendump</a>. <br />
	Now press OK. Notice how the name of the concept has changed.</li>
	<li>Now add a concept named 'welcome' (child) by selecting
	'example' (parent) and then clicking [Add New Concept] <img
		src="../images/graphnewconceptbutton.gif" width="30" height="30" />
	or right clicking 'example' and then selecting [Add Concept].</li>
	<li>Now fill in the following fields in the <a
		href="../images/graphaddconcept.gif" target="_blank">Add Concept
	Dialog Box</a>
	<ul>
		<li>Name : welcome</li>
		<li>Description : Welcome Page</li>
		<li>Resource : file:/example/welcome.xhtml</li>
		<li>Template : page concept</li>
	</ul>
	This is how it looks like finally : <a
		href="../images/graphaddconcept_filled.gif" target="_blank">screendump.</a></li>
	<li>Repeat Step 7 and add concepts 'history','basic','advanced'
	and 'final' respectively. Make sure to use the corresponding names in
	the Resource field. It is advisable to keep the name of the concept and
	name of the resource file as same. This <a
		href="../images/examplehierarchy.gif" target="_blank">screendump</a>
	shows the what the hierarchy looks like.</li>
	<li>Note how the image next to 'example' in the <strong>concept
	hierarchy</strong> has changed. Clicking on it expands the concept, indiacating
	that 'welcome', 'history', 'basic', 'advanced' and 'final' are indeed
	its children.</li>
	<li>Now right click on 'basic' and 'advanced' concepts and select
	[edit]. Change the template of both of them to be [container page
	concept]. (We do this because we create subconcepts for them, so they
	are a page but there are other pages that deal with parts of the
	concept.)</li>
	<li>Now add concept named 'document' to the 'basic' concept by
	selecting 'basic' and then clicking [Add Concept] or right clicking
	'basic' and then selecting <br />
	[Add Concept]. Fill the fields as shown:
	<ul>
		<li>Name : document</li>
		<li>Description : Document Tags</li>
		<li>Resource : file:/example/docuement.xhtml</li>
		<li>Template : page concept</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Repeat Step 10 and add concepts 'lists' and 'textstructure'
	respectively.</li>
	<li>Repeat Step 9 and Step 10 and add 2 new concepts to the
	'advanced' concept. Name these concepts as 'special' and 'anchors'.</li>
</ol>
<p>The final concept hierarchy looks like this....<a
	href="../images/examplehierarchy2.gif" target="_blank">screendump </a></p>
