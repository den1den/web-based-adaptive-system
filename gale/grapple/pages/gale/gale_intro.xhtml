<h1>Introduction to Adaptive Learning and <gale:object name="glossary_gale" /></h1>

<p>
GALE is the successor of the <a href="http://aha.win.tue.nl/">Adaptive Hypermedia Architecture AHA!</a>
that was developed at the <a href="http://www.tue.nl/">Eindhoven University of Technology</a>.
GALE takes objectives of AHA! to a higher level: it is designed to be as <em>flexible</em> and
<em>extensible</em> as possible so as to give authors the freedom to choose between a large number of
adaptive methods and techniques. Some basic characteristic of GALE are:
<ul>
<li>
Courses consist of <em>concepts</em> and <em>relationships</em>, together forming a Domain Model (DM).
This corresponds to the structure of a DM as produced using the DM editor of <gale:object name="glossary_gat" />.
If you wish a course to have an accordion menu "on the left" as in this tutorial you should use
"parent" relationships between concepts to create a concept hierarchy.
</li>
<li>
For each concept GALE keeps track of the user's (learner's) interaction with that concept.
This is done by keeping information in User Model (UM) attributes. Typical attributes would be
<em>knowledge</em> (how much does the learner know about the concept), <em>visited</em> (how often
did the learner access the concept) and <em>suitability</em> (does the learner have the required
foreknowledge to understand the concept).
</li>
<li>
With each concept GALE associates <em>behavior</em> or <em>adaptation rules</em>. A rule may for
instance say that when the concept is accessed the <em>visited</em> counter should be incremented,
the <em>knowledge</em> value should be increased, the <em>knowledge</em> value of a parent concept may
also be increased, the <em>suitability</em> of some other concepts may become "true", etc.
In literature the term Adaptation Model (AM) is often used for this model of concepts with adaptation rules,
but within GALE we consider this as part of the DM. (We do realize that this is a misnomer as a DM is
typically a structure independent of the pedagogy of the course, whereas in GALE DM and adaptation
are mixed. So we sometimes write DM/AM to indicate we need the adaptation that is part of the GALE DM.)
</li>
<li>
Writing individual adaptation rules mentioned above is too cumbersome for authors.
The <gale:object name="glossary_cam" /> editor that is part of GAT
lets you "draw" pedagogical relationships between concepts from which a compiler automatically
generates the adaptation rules for GALE. The implementation of the rules uses <em>template</em>
adaptation rules. The GRAPPLE distribution comes with a sufficiently rich set of predefined templates
so you do not need to study the <gale:object name="glossary_prt" /> tool to create your own templates. 
</li>
<li>
For each concept of DM you typically write one page of learning material. (You can write more pages
and have GALE select one to display based on UM values.)
XHTML is used for the pages,
with some GALE-dependent extensions represented as "gale tags". The &lt;gale:if&gt; tag is used
to conditionally include a bit of text, for instance a short additional explanation the learner
may need. Frequently occurring pieces of information may be conditionally included using the
&lt;gale:object&gt; tag so you need to write the text fragment only once.
</li>
<li>
Links in a GALE course always refer to concepts (never to pages directly). The &lt;gale:a&gt; tag
is used to define an adaptive link. By default links are presented in one of three possible ways:
"good" (blue) which means the link is recommended, "neutral" (purple) which means the link is recommended
but the target was already visited, and "bad" (black) which means the link is not recommended (the target
is not suitable). By not underlining bad links with black text they become effectively hidden within the
text. In the menu on the left you see another way of adapting links: A green ball
<img src="../../../images/GreenBall.gif" /> indicates the link is recommended, a white ball
<img src="../../../images/WhiteBall.gif" /> indicates a visited recommended link and a red ball
<img src="../../../images/RedBall.gif" /> indicates a non-recommended link.
</li>
<li>
Apart from "access" to concepts other forms of interaction can also be associated with adaptation.
GALE can serve XHTML forms to let users set and change certain UM variables, and it can serve and
evaluate multiple-choice tests.
</li>
<li>
In GRAPPLE it is important to give application/course developers maximum freedom in deciding not only
how the adaptation works but also in the design of the look and feel of their application.
Although (to keep authoring simple) GALE comes with predefined presentation and adaptation templates,
it is also reasonably easy for authors to create their own look and feel, either by changing the
configuration (for a static different look and feel) or through a "layout PRT" (for a possibly
adaptively changing look and feel).
</li>
</ul>
The remainder of the GALE part of this tutorial part is aimed at authors who wish to know how the
adaptation behavior described above really works and at authors who wish to change one or more aspects
of this behavior. If you don't like the tags use for adaptation or you want to add more tags with
different behavior, you can. If you want to add a new type of assessment (in addition to the multiple-choice
tests), you can. If you want to change the layout, you can. If you want to process other data types
(besides XHTML or even XML) you can. Almost every aspect of GALE's behavior can be changed either
through a configuration or through the addition of new code for which GALE already contains the necessary
hooks.
