<h1>The <gale:object name="glossary_gale" /> CountModule (&lt;count&gt; tag)</h1>

<p>
The <code>&lt;count&gt;</code> is a special-purpose tag used mainly in a header
to show how many pages (concept with a property "type" with value "page") the learner
has read or still has to read in the current course.
The two ways to use the tag are:
<pre>
  &lt;gale:count     uri="gale://gale.tue.nl/cam/GRAPPLE"    method="done"/&gt;
</pre>
and
<pre>
&lt;gale:count   uri="gale://gale.tue.nl/cam/GRAPPLE"  method="todo"/&gt;
</pre>
GALE does not really work with the notion of a "course" but counts the number of
page concepts of which the URI starts with the given URI.<br />
The resulting numbers for you as learner of this tutorial are
<gale:count   uri="gale://gale.tue.nl/cam/GRAPPLE"  method="done"/>
and
<gale:count   uri="gale://gale.tue.nl/cam/GRAPPLE"  method="todo"/>. These numbers should match what the header shows.
