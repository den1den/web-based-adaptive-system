<h1><gale:object name="glossary_gale" /> Data Structures</h1>

<p>
GALE uses a strongly <em>concept</em>-oriented view on its applications (courses).
All the data relating to a course are stored in what GALE calls the
<gale:a href="gale_domainmodel">Domain Model</gale:a>.
Adaptation in GALE is based on <gale:a href="gale_usermodel">User Model</gale:a> updates.
The schema of the UM (which concepts have which attributes) is part of the DM.
The <gale:a href="gale_adaptationmodel">Adaptation Model</gale:a> is based on
<em>adaptation rules</em> that are executed when <em>events</em> happen (on concepts or attributes).
The adaptation rules are also part of the DM.
</p>
<p>
At runtime there is a per-user instantiation of the UM. This is the focus of our
<gale:a href="gale_usermodel">UM</gale:a> description.
