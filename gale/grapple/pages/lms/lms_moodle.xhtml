<h1>Using Moodle in GRAPPLE</h1>

<p>
GRAPPLE (and specifically the GRAPPLE Conversion Component module) can be installed on
Moodle version 1.9. (The development was done with version 1.9.5. At the time of writing
this tutorial the current version is 1.9.7.)
The software can be found in the LMSconnectors directory of the GRAPPLE software repository.
<a href="http://grapple-project.org/deliverables">GRAPPLE Deliverable 5.2b</a> contains
detailed installation instructions that go beyond the scope of this tutorial.
<a href="http://grapple-project.org/deliverables">GRAPPLE Deliverable 7.5</a> also
describes part of the installation.
</p>
<p>
The installation/configuration mainly consists of the following steps:
<ul>
<li>
Configuring the Shibboleth based authentication service (which is already integrated
in Moodle by default) to use the IdP (identity provider) of the federation of collaborating
institutes and/or companies.
</li>
<li>
Copying code from the GRAPPLE repository to the "moodle/blocks" directory, logging in
and clicking the "Notification" link to setup all the database tables. Code is needed for the
communication to <gale:a href="GUMF"><gale:object name="glossary_gumf" /></gale:a> (gexporter) and for retrieving adaptive
courses from <gale:a href="GALE"><gale:object name="glossary_gale" /></gale:a>.
The figure below shows how to configure the address of
<gale:a href="GEB"><gale:object name="glossary_geb" /></gale:a> and to choose which types of data
are exported to GUMF through GEB.:

<br /><br />
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The process of creating a course and (multiple-choice) tests in Moodle is not influenced
by the use of GRAPPLE. However, the way a GRAPPLE resource is selected is specific. The figure
below shows that a menu item "GRAPPLE resource" was added to the dialog for adding resources:
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
The next step is to select the course from the available ones (retrieved via "getCourses"):
<br /><br />
<img src="../../images/moodle-adaptiveresource.jpg" />
<br /><br />
This will add a new resource to the course, which is a link to an adaptive course,
provided via the GALE (getCourses) facility.
</p>
<p>
Activating the exporting for individual resources (like a quiz) is done by configuring
the corresponding GExporter block:

<br /><br />
With Moodle, when a learner accesses the adaptive learning material it is shown within the
browser window of Moodle, and might look like:
