<h1>Using CLIX in GRAPPLE</h1>

<p>
GRAPPLE (and specifically the GRAPPLE Conversion Component module) can be installed only
on CLIX version 9.0 (and possibly later versions to come).
<a href="http://grapple-project.org/deliverables">GRAPPLE Deliverable 5.2b</a> contains
detailed installation instructions that go beyond the scope of this tutorial.
</p>
<p>
The process of creating a course and (multiple-choice) tests in CLIX is not influenced
by the use of GRAPPLE. However, the way a course is linked to the adaptive learning material
and the communication of test results to <gale:a href="GUMF"><gale:object name="glossary_gumf" /></gale:a>
both are GRAPPLE-specific. To use GRAPPLE you need
to link CLIX to <gale:a href="GEB"><gale:object name="glossary_geb" /></gale:a>.
CLIX comes with a configuration file, "clix.conf" which should contain the following section:
<pre>
[GRAPPLE]createFiles=truesendEvents=truesendName=setUMDatagebEndpoint=http://www.grapple-project.org/GrappleEventBus/gebListenerServiceeventEndpoint=http://www.grapple-project.org/GrappleEventBus/eventGEBListenerServicelistenerName=http://www.learning-demo.eu/grapplix/eventEventListenerService?wsdlmethodList=setUMData,getCoursesResponse,method_test,method_test2
</pre>
Note that the URLs given here are just examples and need to correspond to where GEB really is.<br />
The meaning of these parameters is:
<dl>
<dt>createFiles</dt>
<dd>The parameter "createFiles" denotes, whether for each event a respective XML IMS LIP file shall be created or not
</dd>
<dt>sendEvents</dt>
<dd>The parameter "sendEvents" denotes, whether each event shall be sent to GEB or not (this allows debugging of the events)
</dd>
<dt>sendName</dt>
<dd>The parameter "sendName" contains the name of the event as which the user event shall be sent to GEB.
</dd>
<dt>gebEndpoint</dt><dd>
This parameter specifies the URL at which GEB is reachable. This is necessary for the LMS Event Listener to be registered</dd>
<dt>eventEndpoint</dt>
<dd>This parameter specifies the URL at which the GEB event listener is reachable and hence specifies what URL CLIX shall route the user events to</dd>
<dt>listenerName</dt>
<dd>This parameter specifies the name of the CLIX event listener which needs to be a URL that can be reached from the running GEB instance CLIX wants to register at</dd>
<dt>methodList</dt>
<dd>Finally, the parameter "methodList" allows the administrator to define several event names the CLIX event listener shall listen to.
</dd>
</dl>
Authors, teachers and learners all log in by means of
<a href="http://shibboleth.internet2.edu/">Shibboleth</a>.
<br /><br />
CLIX offers a "Grapple Settings" menu, shown below:<br /><br />
<img src="../../images/clix-grapplesettings.jpg" />
<br /><br />
In CLIX an author can define a new course based on existing adaptive learning material.
The <em>Adaptive Courses</em> menu item shows a list of available adaptive courses,
obtained though a "getCourses" event sent to GEB.
<br /><br />
<img src="../../images/clix-courselist.jpg" />
<br /><br />
CLIX offers a menu item for direct access to
<gale:a href="GAT"><gale:object name="glossary_gat" /></gale:a> through which the conceptual and
pedagogical structure of a course can be defined. Note that GAT requires a separate login as
it is not connected to Shibboleth.
</p>
<p>
The menu item <em>Grapple Event Sharing</em> allows the author to determine what user
events shall be sent to GEB:
<br /><br />
<img src="../../images/clix-eventsharing.jpg" />
<br /><br />
This selection then defines the content for the menu item <em>Grapple Variable Sharing</em>
that enables the author to select which variables are sent to GEB per event:
<br /><br />
<img src="../../images/clix-variablesharing.jpg" />
<br /><br />
Each menu item corresponds to a dialog through which the author can select which variables
are sent to GEB for this specific event. The figure below shows what information is sent to
GEB when a learner accesses a course:
<br /><br />
<img src="../../images/clix-accessrights.jpg" />
<br /><br />
</p>
<p>
Now we consider the creation of a course and a multiple-choice test.
In CLIX courses are created using a "Course Manager".
When selecting content to be used in the course the "getCourses" method is used to
find out which adaptive learning material is available (through <gale:a href="GALE"><gale:object name="glossary_gale" /></gale:a>
servers).
<br /><br />
<img src="../../images/clix-selectcontent.jpg" />
<br /><br />
After also adding some quizzes to the course (using CLIX' own multiple-choice test editor)
the content selection of the course looks like the following figure:
<br /><br />
<img src="../../images/clix-coursecontent.jpg" />
<br /><br />
In CLIX it is possible to specify a learning path, called “Learning logic” for the course
stating that the student has to take the “SolarSystemInterest”  test before the quiz
about the sun (“sun.quizscore”) and that the student has to complete the quiz about
the sun before he is able to access the adaptive course material regarding the
"Milkyway" course. These settings can be done on the “Learning logic”-tab of the course manager.
<br /><br />
<img src="../../images/clix-learninglogic.jpg" />
<br /><br />
This results in the activities becoming accessible (through the LMS) in this sequence only.
(GALE is not involved in this form of adaptation.)
</p>
<p>
When a learner an adaptive course text , for instance the GALE Milkyway adaptive course
a new window is opened. As a result the presentation generated by GALE does not share the
browser window with CLIX, as shown below:
