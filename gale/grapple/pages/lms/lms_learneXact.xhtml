<h1>Using Learn eXact in GRAPPLE</h1>

<p>
GRAPPLE (and specifically the GRAPPLE Conversion Component module) can be installed only
on eLex v. 2009 1 3617 150 (and possibly later versions to come).
<a href="http://grapple-project.org/deliverables">GRAPPLE Deliverable 5.2b</a> contains
detailed installation instructions that go beyond the scope of this tutorial.
</p>
<p>
The process of creating a course and (multiple-choice) tests in Learn eXact is not influenced
by the use of GRAPPLE. However, the way a course is linked to the adaptive learning material
and the communication of test results to GUMF both are GRAPPLE-specific. To use GRAPPLE you need
to link Learn eXact to <gale:a href="GEB"><gale:object name="glossary_geb" /></gale:a>.
A file, called "Web.config" contains the address of the event bus, like:
<pre>
&lt;configuration&gt;   &lt;appSettings&gt;      &lt;add key="gebListenerService" value="http://www.grapple-project.org/GrappleEventBus/gebListenerService?wsdl"/&gt;      &lt;add key="eventGEBListenerService" value="http://www.grapple-project.org/GrappleEventBus/eventGEBListenerService?wsdl"/&gt;   &lt;/appSettings&gt;&lt;/configuration&gt;
</pre>
Note that the URL given here is just an example and needs to correspond to where GEB really is.<br />
Note also that the GRAPPLE software repository does not contain the actual Learn eXact software
extensions as they are proprietary.
</p>
<p>
Once the software installation is complete you can use a web-based dialog to configure the
installation and to define courses and quizzes.
First you need the "getCourses" event in order to find out which courses are served through
<gale:a href="GALE"><gale:object name="glossary_gale" /></gale:a>.<br /><br />
<img src="../../images/learneXact-configuration.jpg" />
<br /><br />
You then need to select which types of events can be made public in the GRAPPLE framework:<br /><br />
<img src="../../images/learneXact-eventselection.jpg" />
<br /><br />
The checkboxes enable the teacher to make <em>course access</em> variables, <em>test/quiz</em> variables, <em>registration</em> variables and <em>learning activity access</em> variables public. This means that
the values (to be stored in
<gale:a href="GUMF"><gale:object name="glossary_gumf" /></gale:a>) can be accessed by other GRAPPLE components.
The teacher can select which
data elements of each type to record for the learners of a course. The screen shot below shows the form for making this selection:<br /><br />

<br /><br />
</p>
<p>
Now we consider the creation of a course and a multiple-choice test. In Learn eXact the author of a course can be different from the teacher. The author can create the course in the <gale:object name="glossary_lms" /> and then publish it and hand it over to a teacher. We now consider the teacher Paul who wishes to create a "Solar System" course which uses a "Sun" quiz. To this end the course is marked as a "structured" course to which content can be added using the content editor:
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
<ul>
<li>
The course in Learn eXact is linked to adaptive course material by first searching for existing adaptive
courses (served through GALE) and then selecting the appropriate one (in this case "Milkyway").<br /><br />
<img src="../../images/learneXact-courseselection.jpg" />
<br /><br />
The adaptive course material is defined as a "URL", so learners get access to it by simply clicking on a link. The adaptive learning material (served by GALE) is presented in a separate browser window.
The actual URL is part of the response to the getCourses request.
</li>
<li>
A multiple-choice test is created using the authoring tool "Exact Packager" and saved
as a SCORM package. It is then incorporated into Learn eXact's ditigal repository by "publishing" it.
By making the test "public" it can be used by others. Paul adds the "Sun" quiz to the learning material
(as shown in the figure of the content editor). When learners take the test the results are stored in GUMF and can be used by GALE for adaptation of the learning material. 
</li>
</ul> 
</p>
<p>
When a learner accesses the "URL" course, for instance the GALE Milkyway adaptive course
a new window is opened. As a result the presentation generated by GALE does not share the
browser window with Learn eXact, as shown below:
