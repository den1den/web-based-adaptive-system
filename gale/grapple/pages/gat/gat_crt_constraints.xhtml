<h1>The Constraints Tab of the <gale:object name="glossary_prt" /> Editor</h1>

<p>
The Constraints Tab of the PRT Editor is shown below:
<br /><br />
<img src="../../images/gat-prt-constraints.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
The constraints tab is intended to define three types of constraints on how the PRT can
be used in the <gale:a href="gat_cam"><gale:object name="glossary_cam" /></gale:a> tool:
You can specify whether it is allowed to have a cycle of PRT instances (of the same PRT)
or not. For instance, a cycle of prerequisites is undesirable as none of the concepts would
ever become suitable, and a cycle of "knowledge propagation" would generate an infinite loop.
You can specify that only concepts with a certain (default) value for some attribute may
be inserted into one of the sockets. You may also disallow that two concepts must not also
appear in a socket of a different PRT that makes use of a common
<gale:object name="glossary_um" /> variable.
Currently the CAM tool ignores all constraint specifications so they have no effect
and are only included to allow the creator of the PRT to express desired constraints.
