<p>
With the PRT tool you define the "heart" of the adaptive functionality that can
be used in the <em>pedagogical models</em> you create with the <gale:a href="gat_cam">Course
(<gale:object name="glossary_cam" />) tool</gale:a>. The PRT tool is only available after
you select the "advanced mode" from the Tools menu.
</p>
<p>
When you create a new PRT the presentation looks like the screenshot below.
This figure shows general information about the PRT.
Other information is available through a row of tabs at the top.
We give a description of each of the tabs on separate pages (see links in the menu).
One exception is the "Debug" tab which lets you inspect the
<gale:a href="gat_crt_data">data structures</gale:a> produced by the tool.

<p>
The screenshot refers to the "G-Prerequisite" PRT, which means that only when enough
knowledge is obtained about the source concepts the target concepts will be considered
"suitable". We use this PRT example in the description of the different tabs.

This tutorial does not contain all possible information about the PRT Editor.
