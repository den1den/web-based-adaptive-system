<h1>The User Model Tab of the <gale:object name="glossary_prt" /> Editor</h1>

<p>
The User Model Tab of the PRT Editor is shown below:
<br /><br />
<img src="../../images/gat-prt-usermodel.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
This tab consists of the following parts:
<dl>
<dt><b><gale:object name="glossary_um" /> Variables</b></dt>
<dd>
This part shows the UM variables that have been defined.
You can click on "New" to create a new UM variable and on "Remove" to delete the
currently selected one (highlighted in blue).
</dd>
<dt><b>General user model variable info</b></dt>
<dd>
Each user model variable must have a name and is assigned to one of the sockets of the PRT.
There are two properties regarding the "Storage Type":
the "public" and "persistence" state.
A variable being public means that it will be shared with
<gale:a href="GUMF"><gale:object name="glossary_gumf" />GUMF</gale:a>,
so that it can be used by other GRAPPLE components.
If a variable is not public it can only be used for the adaptive behavior within
<gale:a href="GALE"><gale:object name="glossary_gale" /></gale:a>.
A variable being persistent means that it will be stored in GALE for further usage.
For a public persistent variable GALE will send updates to GUMF.
If a variable is not persistent, the adaptation engine has to retrieve the value from GUMF
if it is public or use the "Default" if it is not public.
</dd>
<dt><b>Value information</b></dt>
<dd>
Each UM variable must have a data type. The type can be "integer", "float", "string" or
"boolean". (GALE supports arbitrary data types but the PRT tool lets you choose only
between these four.) The "range" is optional. The "default" value has a double meaning.
For persistent variables this is their initial value (assigned when the variable is
created in a user's UM). For non-persistent variables this can be a value but also an
expression that determines the value to be used. Each time the value is needed the
expression is evaluated.
</dd>
<dt><b>Location</b></dt>
<dd>The location fields of user model variables are not used at the moment.
The <gale:a href="gat_um">User Model Mapping</gale:a> tool has taken over this functionality.
</dd>
