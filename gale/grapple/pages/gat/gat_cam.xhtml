<h1>Creating a (Pedagogical) Course Model</h1>

<p>
The Course Adaptation Tool us used to define the pedagogical structure of a course.
(The result is sometimes referred to as the <em>Conceptual Adaptation Model</em> or CAM
and sometimes also as the Pedagogical Course Model.)
Whereas the <gale:object name="glossary_dm" /> represents the conceptual
structure of the topic domain of a course, the CAM connects concepts or sets of concepts
with each other based on pedagogical or presentation goals.
In the DM a relationship connects two concepts (like A is "parent" of B).
In the CAM we can create relationships between an arbitrary number of sets of concepts.
The placeholders for the related (sets of) concepts are called "sockets".
Throughout the description of the Course Adaptation Tool we will use
some pedagogical relationship types (or PRTs),
but we have a separate description of the
<gale:a href="gat_crt">standard pedagogical relationship types</gale:a>
that are part of the GRAPPLE distribution.
<if expr="${gat_crt#visited}==0">
<then>
As an example when some set A of concepts should be studied before you can understand
the concepts of set B we create a <em>prerequisite</em> relationship between set A and set B.
</then>
</if>
The pedagogical relations (may) have <em>adaptive behavior</em> associated with them.
<if expr="${gat_crt#visited}==0">
<then>
For instance, with the prerequisite between A and B links to concepts of set B may be hidden until
all the concepts of A have been studied.</then>
</if>
</p>
<p>
When you open a "Course" the screen may look (more or less) like the screenshot below:
<br /><br />
<img src="../../images/cam.jpg" />
<br /><br />
The pane on the left shows the available types of PRTs (called "rules") available in the
default distribution, created by you, currently used in the course or all relationship types combined.
From this pane PRTs can be dragged onto the right pane which shows the instances of
these types currently in use in the course.
A pedagogical relationship can also be added by selecting "Insert Pedagogical Relation"
from the context menu (right click) used in the right pane. The screenshot below shows
the result of a drag and drop operation. The created instance of the PRT shows the name of the PRT
and the sockets, each with their name. The sockets are initially empty (no "Items") and can be populated
later.
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
</p>
<p>
In addition to the previous method, pedagogical relations can also be copied and pasted.
Copying a relation is done by right-clicking on a relation node and selecting “Copy Relation”.
Then, pasting is done by right-clicking in empty space on the canvas and choosing “Paste Relation”.
This creates a new instance of the same PRT, including possibly modified colurs and shapes,
but with empty sockets. Please note that PRT instances can be copied from other
CAM windows as well as the current window. The screenshots below show the copy/paste context menus.
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
There are multiple ways in which concepts can be added to a socket of a pedagogical relationship.
Concepts can be copied and pasted between sockets of pedagogical relations:
<br /><br />
<img src="../../images/cam-copyconcepts.jpg" />
<img src="../../images/cam-pasteconcepts.jpg" />
<br /><br />
You can also use the item "Edit" from the context menu to edit the socket and insert concepts
form some <gale:object name="glossary_dm" />. This results in a three step dialog shown below: first the set of concepts in the socket
is shown; you then click on "Insert Concept" to get a list of available <gale:object name="glossary_dm" />(s) and finally after selecting
a <gale:object name="glossary_dm" /> you can select one or more concepts from that <gale:object name="glossary_dm" /> and click on "Insert Concept" in that dialog box.
<br /><br />
<img src="../../images/cam-insertconcept1.jpg" />
<br /><br />
<img src="../../images/cam-insertconcept2.jpg" />
<br /><br />
<img src="../../images/cam-insertconcept3.jpg" />
<br /><br />
As you can infer from the dialog described above a course model (CAM) can combine concepts
from several different DMs. This is useful when for instance you wish to add prerequisites
where the a concept requires foreknowledge from concepts in another course.
</p>
<p>
In the current Course Editor all PRT instances are <em>separate</em>. When A is a prerequisite of B
and B is a prerequisite of C the graphical display will show the two sockets for "B" separately.
However, the tool does show in a visual way that sockets of different relationships have concepts in common:
<br /><br />
<img src="../../images/cam-commonconcepts.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
A relationship can also be edited by selecting "Edit" from the context menu:
<br /><br />
<img src="../../images/cam-editcrt.jpg" />
<br /><br />
You can change the color and shape of the presentation of a relationship.
However the most important functionality is that you can change parameter values.
A prerequisite may require "80%" knowledge of the first concept(s), but this number is actually
a parameter that can be changed, for instance to reduce the required level of knowledge.
</p>
<p>
Other editing functions are fairly straightforward: deleting a relationship, deleting the concepts in
a socket (currently you can only delete all concepts at once), saving the course model to the database
or exporting it to a file.
</p>
<p>
When a course (pedagogical structure) is ready you can select "Deploy" from the "File" menu.
This sends the course (CAM) to GALE to enable learners to start studying the course.
</p>
<p>
For the interested reader we have an explanation of the
<gale:a href="gat_cam_data">CAM data structures</gale:a>
which you can access through the "Debug" tab.
To create courses you do not need to know these technical details.
