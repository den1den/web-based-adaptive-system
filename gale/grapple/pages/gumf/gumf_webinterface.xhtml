<h1>The <gale:object name="glossary_gumf" /> Web (Administration) Interface</h1>

<h2>Client registration and details</h2>
<p>
Before client applications (like instances of an <gale:object name="glossary_lms" /> or
<gale:object name="glossary_gale" />) can access GUMF the administrator of the client application
has to register the application in the GUMF Web application, which is shown below:
<br /><br />
<img src="../../images/gumf-clientregistration.jpg" />
<br /><br />Having registered the client application, it appears in the list of client applications of the administrator and the administrator can supply further details about the application as shown below:
<br /><br />
<img src="../../images/gumf-clientdetails.jpg" />
<br /><br />For each client application that is registered, GUMF generates a default data space.
To access the data space from the client application the administrator of the client application
has to provide the id (here: 10) and a secret (here: 14433793371801540) that are listed in the Client
Application Details table.
</p>
<p>To add data to the default data space the client can simply post RDF/XML-serialized
<gale:a href="gumf_grapplestatement">GrappleStatements</gale:a> to the data space
(in the example above, one would have to use
http://localhost:8080/umf/ds/13?ds=10&amp;token=14433793371801540 as endpoint).
For querying, clients can either use the RESTful API or the SeRQL/SPARQL endpoint.</p>

<h2>Data space subscriptions</h2>
<p>
In addition to its own data space a client application can also subscribe to other data spaces.
When a client application has subscribed to a data space then it can access the data that
is made available via the data space. However, it cannot store data in the data space
it has subscribed to. To subscribe a client application to another data space the administrator of the
client has to go to the client details page as shown in the figure above. In the "Add subscription"
form the administrator can select a data space and write a short message to the data space
administrator that explains why she wants her client application to subscribe to the data space.
Having clicked the send button the administrator of the data space will get a notification,
where she can accept or deny the subscription request as shown in the figure below:<br /><br />
<img src="../../images/gumf-subscription.jpg" />
<br /><br />If the administrator of the data space has accepted the request then the data space is listed among the
"current subscriptions" (see figure below) and can now be queried by the client application just like the
client's default data space.

</p>
<h2>Configuration of data spaces</h2>
<p>
Administrators can add new data spaces to GUMF and can then configure their data spaces.
For example, you can add plug-ins to a data space via the "add plug-in" button shown in the figure below:
<br /><br />
<img src="../../images/gumf-dataspacedetails.jpg" />
<br /><br />These plug-ins enrich a data space, e.g., by gathering data from other data sources,
reasoning on the data available in the data space or by mapping different schemas and vocabularies
so that the client application receives data according to its preferred schema.
