<h2>The Application Management Tool</h2>

<p>In order to manage an application as an author the <em>application
management tool</em>, or AMT for short, offers a user-friendly interface to
copy files between your local PC and the AHA! server. AMT works as a <em>signed</em>
Java applet, in order to be able to access your local file system. The
figure below shows the AMT interface.</p>
<p><img src="../images/amt.gif" /></p>
<p>The left half of the window gives an "explorer-like" view of your
local file system. The right half can either show the <em>application
files</em> which are all the files that you create as an author and that the
server uses when the application is running. The alternative view shows
the <em>author files</em> which are the files that are created using the
special AHA! authoring tools for the <gale:a href="domainmodel">domain model</gale:a>.
When you double-click on one of these files the appropriate authoring
tool is started automatically. The files created by the authoring tools
(<gale:a href="graphauthor">Graph Author</gale:a> and <gale:a
	href="concepteditor">Concept Editor</gale:a>) are not stored on your
PC, only on the server.</p>

<p>AMT lets you create a new application (including a folder for the
"Application Files" and skeleton "Author Files". You can right-click on
an application to select an authoring tool to open, and you can also opt
to delete the domain model from AHA!. This means that although the files
remain (you can delete those as well, but separately) the AHA! server
will no longer serve the application. <br />
When you install a new AHA! distribution, it comes with this tutorial
pre-installed. You can use the "delete domain model from AHA!" command
in AMT to stop serving the tutorial from your server.</p>
