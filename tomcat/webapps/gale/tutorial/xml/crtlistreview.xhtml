<h3>Further explanation</h3>
<p>The <a href="../images/crtlist.gif" target="_blank">list that
comes with this AHA! release and tutorial</a> contains a number of concept
relationship types for illustration purposes, as well as some commonly
used ones like "knowledge_propagation", "knowledge update" and
"prerequisite". The list is extracted from a list of templates. You can
<gale:a href="concepttemplate.xhtml">create your own
templates</gale:a>, but that requires a thorough knowledge of the AHA! adaptation
rule language.</p>
<p>For further reference, you can visit the <gale:a
