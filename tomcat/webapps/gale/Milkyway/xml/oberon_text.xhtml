Oberon, also designated Uranus IV, is the outermost major moon of the planet Uranus. It is the second largest and second most massive of Uranian moons, and the ninth most massive moon in the Solar System. Oberon was discovered by William Herschel in 1787 and named after a character in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. Oberon's orbit lies partially outside Uranus's magnetosphere.
