Phobos (systematic designation: Mars I) is the larger and closer of Mars' two small moons, the other being Deimos. It is named after the Greek god Phobos (which means "fear"), a son of Ares (Mars). A small, irregularly shaped object, Phobos orbits about 9377 km from the center of Mars, closer to its primary than any other planetary moon.
