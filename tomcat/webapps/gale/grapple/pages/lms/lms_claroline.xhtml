<h1>Using Claroline in GRAPPLE</h1>

<p>
GRAPPLE (and specifically the GRAPPLE Conversion Component module) can be installed on
Claroline version 1.10.
The integration requires two additional modules for Claroline:
<ol>
<li>The first one is named "GRPPLAD" and allows the Claroline kernel to send data over
<gale:a href="GEB"><gale:object name="glossary_geb" /></gale:a>.
</li>
<li>The second one named "GRAPPLE" is a fork from the Claroline Learning Path tool with additional features needed to send data to GRAPPLE.</li>
</ol>
<a href="http://grapple-project.org/deliverables">GRAPPLE Deliverable 5.2b</a> contains
detailed installation instructions that go beyond the scope of this tutorial.
Once the installation is complete Claroline needs to be told how to connect to GEB
and which data types will be sent to <gale:a href="GUMF"><gale:object name="glossary_gumf" /></gale:a> over GEB:
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
For tests/quizzes served by Claroline you need to configure which data elements are
communicated to (GUMF via) GEB:<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Note that these are global settings (for the entire Claroline server).
</p>
<p>
Next the teacher can add a GRAPPLE course by creating a learning path in a Claroline course space.
The Learning Path tool in Claroline allows the teacher to link resources
(Claroline documents and exercises, GRAPPLE course, etc.) and define the path to navigate
between them by branching conditions or prerequesites.To add a GRAPPLE course as a resource in a learning path, the teacher has to click on
"Import a GRAPPLE course" to  get a list of available GRAPPLE courses (the result of a
"getCourses" request),
choose the course he wants to add in this list and click on the import button:
<br /><br />

Each resource in the course can be made available depending on the completion of other activities.
Such sequencing is adaptation independent of the adaptation performed by <gale:a href="GALE"><gale:object name="glossary_gale" /></gale:a>.<br /><br />
<img src="../../images/claroline-learningpath.jpg" /><br /><br />With Claroline, when a learner accesses the adaptive learning material it is shown within the
browser window of Claroline, and might look like:
