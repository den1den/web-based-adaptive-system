<h1>Using Sakai in GRAPPLE</h1>

<p>
GRAPPLE (and specifically the GRAPPLE Conversion Component module) can be installed on
Sakai versions 2.5 and 2.6. 
A tool imports all libraries automatically. You then need to edit the file
"tomcat/sakai/sakai.properties" to indicate:
<ul>
<li>
the location (URL) of <gale:a href="GEB"><gale:object name="glossary_geb" /></gale:a>;
</li>
<li>
the URL where Sakai can register its listener on GEB:<br />grapple.geb.registerListenerURL = http://localhost:9000/GrappleEventBus/gebListenerService?wsdl
</li>
<li>the URL where Sakai can send events to:<br />grapple.geb.sendEventURL = http://localhost:9000/GrappleEventBus/eventGEBListenerService?wsdl
</li>
</ul>To deploy this tool to Sakai you only have to execute "mvn clean install sakai:deploy"
in the grapple directory.It will then copy the generated warfile to the tomcat/webapps directory and (re-)load itself.
</p>
<p>
An administrator can assign GRAPPLE courses to users.
The following screenshot is how the GRAPPLE tool might look for an administrator:

<br /><br />
Although the admin can refresh the list of <gale:a href="GALE"><gale:object name="glossary_gale" /></gale:a> courses
(called Grapple Courses in the screenshot) this is done automatically every 2 hours.
<br />Sakai will register itself to GEB and if that fails it will automatically retry.
The screenshot shows that the listener is active.
<br />
The "Group events selection" link will take the admin to a form where (s)he can select
which events should be published to GEB:
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
The administrator must assign a course to a teacher, which is a three step process:
select user, select course, then confirmation.

With Sakai, when a learner accesses the adaptive learning material it is shown within the
browser window of Sakai.
