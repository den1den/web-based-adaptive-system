<h1>The Global GRAPPLE Infrastructure</h1>

<p>
The figure below shows the overall architecture of GRAPPLE:
</p>
<img src="../images/architecture.jpg" />
<p>
At the top of the figure we see two components that connect several of the underlying components.
For this tutorial the underlying components are most important, but we wish to first mention the
role of the top ones.
</p>
<p>
The communication between the various GRAPPLE components is managed by
<gale:a href="GEB"><gale:object name="glossary_geb" /></gale:a>. This is an <em>asynchronous</em> communication
channel between the other components. GRAPPLE components can send messages to the event bus and can
"listen" to certain events. This is not a <em>request/response</em> communication like for instance
HTTP used between Web browsers and servers. Components should never block while waiting for a response
from another component.
</p>
<p>
Many institutes and companies can share access to GRAPPLE. They can share courses and <gale:object name="glossary_um" />s.
To enable their users to access GRAPPLE the Shibboleth single sign-on facility is used.
<a href="http://shibboleth.internet2.edu/">Shibboleth</a> is used in many networks of shared information services
and its development is completely independent from GRAPPLE. Shibboleth is only used for the identification
of learners. The authoring environment currently does not use it.
</p>

<p>
A typical scenario for using GRAPPLE (as teacher) is that you set up access to a course on your
institute's/company's <gale:a href="LMS"><gale:object name="glossary_lms" /></gale:a>. For the course you
create a number of communication channels, activities, assignments and tests. The learning process
and progress depends on the performance of learners on these assignments and tests. The results
are stored not only in the LMS' "gradebook" but also in <gale:a href="GUMF"><gale:object name="glossary_gumf" /></gale:a>.
You then create <em>adaptive course material</em> in which the adaptation may depend on the
user's progress through the "written" material and on the test/assignment results.
The structure and adaptation of the course is created using <gale:a href="GAT"><gale:object name="glossary_gat" /></gale:a> and
the content is created using any XML editor you prefer. The adaptive course material is then
served to the learners through <gale:a href="GALE"><gale:object name="glossary_gale" /></gale:a>.
GALE may use information about the learner, obtained from GUMF, but also uses its internal detailed <gale:object name="glossary_um" /> to guide the student through the learning process. Some information about this progress can be communicated
from GALE back to GUMF where it may later be used for adaptation in (the same or) other courses.
