<h1>The General Tab of the <gale:object name="glossary_prt" /> Editor</h1>

<p>
The General Tab of the PRT Editor is shown below:
<br /><br />
<img src="../../images/gat-prt-general.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
This tab consists of the following parts:
<dl>
<dt><b>Information on title and description</b></dt><dd>The title and description of the PRT have been defined in the property dialogue when creating
the PRT. It cannot be changed within the PRT Tool. However, in the "Manage Models" section of the
<gale:object name="glossary_gat" /> shell, there is a button to modify properties.
In order to modify the properties, the PRT tool has to be closed, then the properties can be changed,
and then the PRT can be opened again.
</dd>
<dt><b>Defining the visual representation</b></dt>
<dd>In the second part the visual representation can be specified. In the
<gale:a href="gat_cam"><gale:object name="glossary_cam" /> Tool</gale:a>, PRTs are graphically depicted
and represented in a specific color and with a symbol. This color and symbol can be changed here by
selecting the symbol in the pull down list and the color in the color chooser.
</dd><dt><b>Defining the structure of the PRT</b></dt>
<dd>At the bottom of this tab the structure of the PRT can be specified. This is one of the most important
parts of the PRT definition. The basic element of a PRT is the socket, which is a container where domain
concepts (of the domain model) can be inserted as soon as the PRT is inserted in a CAM. In the CRT the
properties of the socket are defined. First the name has to be specified, which is used to address
the socket in the adaptation code. Second the minimum and maximum number of concepts to be inserted
in the respective socket is determined. Third the structure of the PRT is defined: Either a directed
structure can be chosen, which includes exactly two sockets, where one is the sources and the other
is the target socket. The meaning of source and target structure, however, is defined in the code part.
If an undirected structure is chosen, then the PRT can be made up of an arbitrary number of sockets.
In this case type and name has to be specified for each socket.
<br />
Note that the names "source" and "target" determine that the PRT is directed. When using other names
the PRT becomes undirected.
