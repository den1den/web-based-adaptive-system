<h1>The Domain Relations Tab in the <gale:object name="glossary_prt" /> Editor</h1>

<p>
The Domain Relations Tab of the PRT Editor is shown below:
<br /><br />
<img src="../../images/gat-prt-domainrelations.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
In this tab you can assign this PRT to some domain relations.
This means that when the PRT is used in a
<gale:a href="gat_cam"><gale:object name="glossary_cam" /></gale:a> (without the need to assign
any concepts to sockets) the PRT will automatically be applied to all instances of a
<gale:object name="glossary_dm" /> relation.
For instance, one could automatically associate a "knowledge propagation" PRT with all instances
of a "parent" DM relation to have knowledge propagated throughout the concept hierarchy of a course.
Unfortunately the CAM tool does not currently support this, so the Domain Relations tab has
no effect.
