<h1><gale:object name="glossary_um" /> Mapping</h1>

<p>
When learners are studying a course they are interacting with an <gale:a href="LMS"><gale:object name="glossary_lms" /></gale:a>
(for instance for multiple-choice tests or handing in assignments) and with
<gale:a href="GALE"><gale:object name="glossary_gale" /></gale:a> (for reading adaptive learning material).
The interaction with the LMS may result in <gale:object name="glossary_um" /> data stored in
<gale:a href="GUMF"><gale:object name="glossary_gumf" /></gale:a>.
This data can be retrieved by GALE and used for adaptation.
However, the LMS does not store the data under the same identifiers as those used by GALE, and the values may be incompatible,
like on a different scale. Every LMS may use different value ranges as well.
So the identifiers and values need to be mapped onto each other in order for interaction with an LMS to really influence
the adaptation in GALE.
</p>
<p>
The "Tools" menu of <gale:object name="glossary_gat" /> offers a "User Model" item that activates the
<gale:object name="glossary_um" /> Mapping tool that looks like the screenshot below:
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
The learner (User: ?learner) performs a test on the LMS. The result has an internal identifier on the LMS, which is
118316 in the example, and it has an identifier in GUMF, which is
"http://www.grapple-project.org/ims-lip/completedTest" (only partially visible in the screenshot).
The test result (Level: ?level) is not on the same scale as the typical knowledge values
on a scale of 0-100 used by GALE.
<br />
The mapping rule transforms this LMS result into another entry for GUMF: the new entry is identified in GUMF as
"http://gale.tue.nl/predicate/knowledge" and is known by GALE as
"gale://gale.tue.nl/cam/SelfmanagementTest_Course/testresult" (again only partially visible).
The value from ?level is multiplied by 20. So if the LMS gives a score between 0 and 5 the value that will be
retrieved by GALE is a score between 0 and 100.
