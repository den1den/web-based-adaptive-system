<h1>Authoring Courses for GRAPPLE</h1>

<p>
GRAPPLE is intended to support learning based on the concept of <em>courses</em>.
This corresponds to the most common way in which education is organized in schools,
universities and in company training. Creating (authoring) a course generally consists
of three steps:
<ul>
<li>
The <em>topics</em> (in GRAPPLE terminology these are <em>concepts</em>) of the course
are determined. This may start with an unordered list, but is typically (later) organized
into a <em>hierarchy</em>. The structure of the <em>topic domain</em> of the course is
called the Domain Model (DM) and is defined using the <gale:a href="gat_dm">Domain Model Tool</gale:a>.
</li>
<li>
A reading or study order is determined for the topics of the course. In a traditional course
one single sequence of topics is chosen which is used during lectures and/or is the order
in which the topics appear in a course text (and its table of contents).
GRAPPLE aims at using (web-based) <em>hypertext</em> or <em>hypermedia</em> for a course text.
A rich link structure connects many topics in a seemingly random way, based on semantic
relationships between topics. However, not every possible sequence of following links to navigate
through the course text is suitable for learning: some topics need to be studied before some other
topics can be learned and understood. To offer guidance to the learner a structure of
<em>pedagogical relationships</em> is created, typically consisting of so called <em>prerequisites</em>,
and these are used to <em>adapt</em> the link structure on the fly.
The <gale:a href="gat_cam">Course Adaptation Tool</gale:a> is used to define the pedagogical
structure of a course (which is sometimes called <em>Conceptual Adaptation Model</em> or CAM for historical reasons).
</li>
<li>
For each course topic (or concept) some learning material needs to be written.
In GRAPPLE the most commonly used content type for learning material is
XHTML, an XML-compliant version of HTML. (HTML can be used as well,
and is internally converted to XHTML before being used further.)
<!-- ZZZ: Maybe we can add a link to the specific part of GALE later. -->
However, any XML-based format
can be used with <gale:a href="GALE"><gale:object name="glossary_gale" /></gale:a>.
GRAPPLE does not include an editor for the content. Any editor capable of creating XML documents
can be used for this.
</li>
</ul>
After logging in on the GRAPPLE Authoring Tool (GAT) the following welcome screen is presented:
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
Actions can be initiated through the menus, buttons in the toolbar or by clicking on any of
the large colored sections of the welcome screen.
</p>
<p>
When creating courses you might occasionally find that you need a pedagogical relationship
that is not provided by GRAPPLE. There is a <gale:a href="gat_crttool">Pedagogical Relationship Types Editor</gale:a>
that lets you create new pedagogical relationship types or PRTs.
Most authors/teachers will not need to use this tool and therefore it is hidden in the welcome screen
and the menus. When you select Tools-&gt;Advanced Mode the welcome screen and menus change and you
get access to the Pedagogical Relationship Types editor.
</p>
<p>
When you have studied the different GAT-related topics you should take
this <gale:a href="gat_test">Quiz about GAT</gale:a>.
Please note that you can take this test only once.
