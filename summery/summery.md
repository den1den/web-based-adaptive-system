# Adaptation
Because everyone is different
- Non-adaptive systems = Do not depend on environmental factors and history
 - Like preferences
 - Algorithms like obstruction avoidance
- First order adaptive systems = adaptation rules are fixed
 - Remembers what you like
- Second order adaptive systems = adaptation rules are itself adaptive
 - Changes how it remembers

Examples: encyclopedia, documentation, shopping sites, airline reservation

#### Pros
- Better usability satisfaction
  - Boring actions are automated
  - Effective display of information, less actions needed
- Economical benefits? <!--TODO: Slide 16 lecture 1 -->

#### Cons
- Its personal and may not help everyone
- Information bubble / censorship

## Architecture
- forward reasoning: register conclusions to a user-model, adapt based on user-model.
- backward reasoning: store rules and draw conclusions when needed.
#### The user
- provides data
- edits the user-model (optionally)
- get adaptation effects

*Question loop*



# Hypermedia
- Hypermedia is to big, "Lost in hyperspace".
- Hard to grasp because many paths possible
- Adaptation helps the user understand and navigate

# Educational
- more freedom for the learner
- guidance instead of enforced sequence
- solve comprehension problems via navigation
- adaptation based on reading as well as tests


# Terminology
- user-based adaptive system = adapt to user
- web-based = request response paradigm
- hypertext = text that is navigable
- hypermedia = hypertext + multimedia
#### Abbreviations
- AEH(S): Adaptive educational hypermedia (systems)
- AES: Adaptive educational systems
- ALE: Adaptive learning environments
