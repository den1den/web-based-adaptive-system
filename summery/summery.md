# Adaptation
Because everyone is different
- Non-adaptive systems = Do not depend on environmental factors and history
 - Like preferences
 - Algorithms like obstruction avoidance
- First order adaptive systems = adaptation rules are fixed
 - Remembers what you like
- Second order adaptive systems = adaptation rules are itself adaptive
 - Changes how it remembers

Examples: encyclopedia, documentation, shopping sites, airline reservation

#### Pros
- Better usability satisfaction
  - Boring actions are automated
  - Effective display of information, less actions needed
- Economical benefits? <!--TODO: Slide 16 lecture 1 -->

#### Cons
- Its personal and may not help everyone
- Information bubble / censorship

## Architecture
- forward reasoning: register conclusions to a user-model, adapt based on user-model.
- backward reasoning: store rules and draw conclusions when needed.
#### The user
- provides data
- edits the user-model (optionally)
- get adaptation effects

# Hypermedia
- Hypermedia is to big, "Lost in hyperspace".
- Hard to grasp because many paths possible
- Adaptation helps the user understand and navigate

# Educational
- cheaper
- more freedom for the learner
 - guidance instead of enforced sequence
- solve comprehension problems via navigation
- adaptation with tests

- System adapts to: knowledge and learning styles

#### course topics
are linked by:
- knowledge propagation
- prerequisite types
 - Top down: deductive, from abstract to concrete
 - Bottom up: inductive, from concrete to abstract
- prerequisite issues:
  - How to create the order?
  - How to verify studied (subtly)
  - Before != directly Before
  - Circular dependencies
  - Transitivity can apply
#### Learning styles
- visual vs verbal
- global (large jumps) vs sequential
- active vs reflective (analyze before conclusion)
#### Adaptation strategies
- selection of media
- sorting of information
- navigation paths: breath-first vs depth-first
- media format: text vs video
- feedback: positive/negative. Predfined/adaptable/adaptive
 - adapt to: attention/memory/cognative abilities/learning styles/hearing/vision/interaction
 - by: feedback time/media format/frequency of feedback/feedback complexity



# Terminology
- user-based adaptive system = adapt to user
- web-based = request response paradigm
- hypertext = text that is navigable
- hypermedia = hypertext + multimedia
