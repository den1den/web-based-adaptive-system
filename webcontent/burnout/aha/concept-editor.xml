<gale:text tag="default;long" type="creole">The concept editor is a Java-based authoring
tool that allows the creation of [[models-example|.aha DM/AM models]] using a GUI. It was
developed by a student, Koen Verheyen. The tool allows low level access to the adaptation
rules, but is impractical to use when creating anything else than tiny adaptive
applications. A high-level tool like the [[graph-author|Graph Author]] is
recommended.</gale:text>

<gale:text tag="default" type="creole">The following two screendumps of the concept editor
show some of the aspects of creating a DM/AM. The first image shows that the concept
'de_koninck' has attributes 'access' and 'knowledge', and that three actions or
generateListItems are associated with this attribute. The interface shows the
condition (&lt;req>) of each rule. The second image shows how the third generateListItem is
defined. While entering expressions (like 'beer.interest > 50') the tool shows the
expression in red until it is syntactically correct and uses only concepts and attributes
that have been previously defined. This guarantees that the complete structure of
concepts, attributes and generateListItems is sound.
