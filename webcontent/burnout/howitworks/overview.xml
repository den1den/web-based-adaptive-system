<gale:text type="creole">The HTTP request URL (that can be seen in the address bar)
contains the name of the concept requested. For the current concept 'How It Works' that
is: <gale:variable expr="${../howitworks}.getUriString()"/>. A file on the server
describes how accessing this concept should affect the user model. Every time a link is
followed, the user model is updated. Before the page is sent, the server will use
information in the user model to change the page and make it 'more suitable' to your
needs. Various [[../research/taxonomy|techniques]] are used to change the information in
the page.</gale:text>
