<gale:text type="creole">The [[../gale/domain-model|domain model]] that describes the
thesis is stored in [[../gale/gam/bundled|.gam files]]. The root .gam file is located at
<a>
<gale:attr-variable name="href" expr="${../thesis}.getUri().resolve(&quot;concepts.gam&quot;)" />
<gale:variable expr="${../thesis}.getUri().resolve(&quot;concepts.gam&quot;)" /></a>.
<gale:if expr="${../gale/system/variable-module#known} &amp;&amp; ${../gale/system/attr-variable-module#known}">
The location of the .gam file was calculated using a combination of the
<gale:a href="../gale/system/variable-module">'variable'</gale:a> and
<gale:a href="../gale/system/attr-variable-module">'attr-variable'</gale:a> modules:

<pre>
&lt;a class="good">
&lt;gale:attr-variable name="href"
    expr="${.}.getUri().resolve(&quot;concepts.gam&quot;)" />
&lt;gale:variable
    expr="${.}.getUri().resolve(&quot;concepts.gam&quot;)" />
&lt;/a>
</pre>

<gale:text type="creole">This file can look a bit complex at first. But then again, this
thesis uses a lot of complex adaptation. One of the nice features of [[../gale/gam|GAM]]
is that it allows concept inheritance accross application boundaries. This means that a
less 'advanced' author (read 'an author that does not want to know everything about the
adaptation details') can inherit the adaptive behavior defined here. This is done by
creating concepts that inherit from the thesis, in GAM:

<pre>
myconcept {
    ->(extends)<gale:variable expr="${../_concept}.getUriString()" />
    . . .
}
</pre>

Inheritance is a powerful feature that allows the domain and adaptation model to be
distributed and maintained by many authors (and different types of authors), thus creating
an open model of adaptation.
