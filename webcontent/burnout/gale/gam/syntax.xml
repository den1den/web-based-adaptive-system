<gale:text tag="short" flat="true" type="creole">an informal description of the
[[../gam|GAM]] language using examples</gale:text>

<gale:text tag="long" type="creole"><gale:object name="../gam?tags=long" />

The general syntax of a GAM file:

{{{
concept_uri_1 { 
    ...
}
concept_uri_2 {
    property 'value'
    ...
}
...
}}}
</gale:text>

<gale:text tag="default" type="creole">A [[../gam|GAM]] definition can contain multiple
concept definitions. This section describes the syntax informally. The general structure
is as follows:

{{{
concept_uri_1 { //comment on the first concept
    ...
}
concept_uri_2 { //comment on the second concept
    ...
}
...
}}}

The URIs can be either absolute or relative. A relative URI is resolved depending on the
context of the GAM definition. If the definition is stored in a file, the location of that
file (in the file system or on the web using a URL) might be used as the base
URI. Comments start with two slashes (~//) and end at the end of the line.

A concept is defined by its properties, [[attribute]]s and [[relation]]s. The syntax of
properties is:

{{{
http://gale.win.tue.nl/beer {
    ...
    title "Beer and all its aspects"
    event `
        ...
    `
    type 'page'
    ...
}
}}}

Any quote (' or " or `) can be used to quote the contents of a property. The safest to use
is probably the back-quote (`), especially when the contents is some form of expression or
code. If the contents does not contain a quote (') or double-quote ("), then those can be
used as well.

It is not necessary to start every property on a new line, but it improves readability.
This is also valid:

{{{
http://gale.win.tue.nl/beer {type 'page' title "Beer and all its aspects"}
}}}
