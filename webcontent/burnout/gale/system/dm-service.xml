<gale:text tag="short" flat="true" type="creole">a service that provides domain model data
to other components in GALE, like the [[adaptation-engine|\AE]] and [[um-service|\UM
service]].</gale:text>

<gale:text tag="default;long" type="creole">A domain model service provides other
components with concept definitions. The service registers on the event bus and would at
least listen for the [[event-types|'getdm' event]]. Only one service usually implements
the other DM methods: the database {{{DMService}}} that is part of GALE.</gale:text>

<gale:text tag="default" type="creole">This {{{DMService}}} (with implementation class
{{{DMServiceImpl}}}) implements all DM methods. It uses the database connection
[[configuration|configured]] in {{{galeconfig.xml}}}. Whenever (new) concepts are
requested through 'getdm', the database is accessed to retrieve the concepts based on
their URI. New concepts can be stored in the database by calling 'setdm'. This will lead
to 'updatedm' events on a different thread to inform the other components of the changed
domain model.

Various formats are supported through different DM services, as explained below.
[[extending-service|New services]] can be added easily.

==== AHA3 DM service ====

The {{{AHA3ServiceImpl}}} reads [[../../aha/models-example|.aha files]] stored in the
$GALE_HOME/config directory. They are converted on the fly to the new domain and
adaptation model used by GALE. You can still find an example on every GALE installation in
the <a><gale:attr-variable name="href"
expr="GaleUtil.getContextURL(gale.req())+&quot;/config/tutorial.aha&quot;"
/>tutorial.aha</a> file. The concepts are available by converting the name like this:
tutorial.welcome -> <gale:a href="gale://gale.tue.nl/aha3/tutorial/welcome"
adapt="false">gale://gale.tue.nl/aha3/tutorial/welcome</gale:a>.

==== GDOM DM service ====

The {{{GDOMServiceImpl}}} reads [[../gdom|.gdom files]] stored in the $GALE_HOME/config
directory. These files constitute an accurate description of the domain model used by
GALE. Every GALE installation includes the [[../../research/grapple|GRAPPLE]] <gale:a
adapt="false" href="gale://gale.tue.nl/course/grapple/GRAPPLE">tutorial</gale:a>. The
.gdom file describing the tutorial is called <a><gale:attr-variable name="href"
expr="GaleUtil.getContextURL(gale.req())+&quot;/config/grapple.gdom&quot;"
/>grapple.gdom</a>.

==== GAM Service ====

The {{{GAMServiceImpl}}} loads concept definitions from .gam files that can be found in a
location relative to the concept URI. The GAM Service uses timestamps on the .gam files
retrieved to detect changes. When a .gam file has changed, that file (and the
[[../gam/bundled|related modules]]) are loaded again and send over the event bus in an
'updatedm' event. This allows almost real-time editing of a domain model.</gale:text>
