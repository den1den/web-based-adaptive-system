<gale:text tag="short" flat="true" type="creole">a module that selects part of the
contents of the associated XML element based on a provided expression</gale:text>

<gale:text tag="long" type="creole">{{{
&lt;gale:if expr="!${#suitability}">&lt;p>This topic is probably not suitable for you.
Please consider studying these topics first:
...
&lt;/p>&lt;/gale:if>
}}}

The {{{&lt;gale:if>}}} tag evaluates the expression in the {{{expr}}} attribute and only
includes the content if the result is {{{true}}}. {{{&lt;gale:then>}}} and
{{{&lt;gale:else>}}} blocks are also an option.</gale:text>

<gale:text tag="default" type="creole" expr="${processors#known}">The 'if' module allows
an XML fragment to be conditionally included. The [[configuration|configuration]] links
the 'if' module to the &lt;gale:if> tag. By default the valid mime types are:
* "text/xhtml"
* "text/xml"
* "application/xml"
* "application/smil"</gale:text>

<gale:text tag="default" type="creole">There are two ways to use the {{{&lt;gale:if>}}}
tag. In both ways, the [[../gale-code|GALE (EL) code]] expression that is used to decide
if a fragment of XML is to be included, is placed in an 'expr' attribute. The first option
is to place the content directly as subelements of the {{{&lt;gale:if>}}} tag.

{{{
&lt;gale:if expr="!${#suitability}">&lt;p>This topic is probably not suitable for you.
Please consider studying these topics first:
...
&lt;/p>&lt;/gale:if>
}}}

The containing XML fragment is only included if the {{{#suitability}}}
[[../user-model|user model]] variable is false.

The other option is to include a {{{&lt;gale:then>}}} and optionally a
{{{&lt;gale:else>}}} tag. The {{{&lt;gale:then>}}} should always immediately follow the
{{{&lt;gale:if>}}} tag, and if an 'else' block is included, it should follow the 'then'
block.

{{{
&lt;gale:if expr="${test#done}">
  &lt;gale:then>
    You have already completed the test. Your score was &lt;gale:variable expr="${test#score}" />.
  &lt;/gale:then>
  &lt;gale:else>
    You can assess your knowledge by completing a small &lt;gale:a href="test">test&lt;/gale:a>.
  &lt;/gale:else>
&lt;/gale:if>
}}}
