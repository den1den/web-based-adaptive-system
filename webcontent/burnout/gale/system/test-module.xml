<gale:text tag="default" type="creole" expr="${processors#known}">The 'test' module
creates multiple choice tests. The [[configuration|configuration]] links the 'test' module
to the &lt;gale:test> tag. By default the only valid mime type is:
* "text/xhtml"</gale:text>

<gale:text tag="default;long" type="creole">A multiple choice test in GALE can be created
using the &lt;gale:test> tag. Several questions can be defined and each question can have
multiple or just one good answer(s). When the test is submitted, the result can have an
effect on the user model.</gale:text>

<gale:text tag="default" type="creole">The syntax is described by providing a small
example:

The {{{&lt;gale:test>}}} tag has several parameters:
* 'title' will create a &lt;h1> title for the test.
* 'action' contains code that will be executed when the test is submitted. This code can
  use the {{{value}}} variable to retrieve a score of 0 to 100 based on the number of
  correct answers.
* 'expr' an expression that determines if the test is allowed or not.
* 'ask' the number of questions to ask in each test.
* 'alt' the alternative text to display when the test is no longer allowed.
* 'verbose' whether to display explanations when the test is complete.

The contents of the {{{&lt;gale:test>}}} element is a series of questions and one
{{{&lt;gale:result>}}} element, that is displayed at the end of the explanation page. Each
question can contain several answers. When the test is shown, a random set of answers is
selected as specified by the 'answers' attribute. This set will contain a number of right
answers as specified by the 'right' attribute. If more than one answer is correct, check
boxes are used. Otherwise radio buttons are used to display the question. All questions
and answers are picked and ordered at random.</gale:text>
