<gale:text tag="short" flat="true" type="creole">a component of the
[[adaptation-engine|\AE]] that resolves the HTTP request to a specific concept</gale:text>

<gale:text tag="long;default" type="creole">The {{{ConceptManager}}} is the first
component (and for many requests the only component) that analyzes the actual HTTP
request. It is responsible for identifying the requested concept. The
{{{DefaultConceptManager}}} considers two options:
* There is additional path information after the servlet request that identifies the
  concept.
* If the first option did not identify a concept, then there is a request parameter called
  'concept' that identifies it.
</gale:text>

<gale:text tag="default" type="creole">Any other method of transmitting the concept URI to
GALE would require an extension or replacement of the {{{ConceptManager}}}.

The {{{DefaultConceptManager}}} also allows requests for resources located in the
{{{GALE_HOME}}} directory and in the {{{WEB-INF/lib}}} directory. When the URL (without
query string) contains the string '${home}/', the path after that is used to locate the
resource relative to the {{{GALE_HOME}}} directory. When the URL (without query string)
contains the string '${lib}/', the path after that is used to locate the resource relative
to the {{{WEB-INF/lib}}} directory. These options are mostly for internal use by
GALE.</gale:text>
