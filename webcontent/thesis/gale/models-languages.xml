<gale:text tag="short" flat="true" type="creole">various models, like the
[[domain-model|domain model]], and languages, like [[gam|GAM]], used throughout
[[../gale|GALE]] to perform adaptation</gale:text>

<gale:text tag="long" type="creole">To retrieve content and perform adaptation,
[[../gale|GALE]] needs information about the problem [[domain-model|domain]], and the
[[user-model|user]]. How events update the user model is described in the
[[adaptation-model|adaptation model]].

Languages, like [[gam|GAM]] and [[gale-code|GALE (EL) code]], allow the description of the
dynamic behavior of the application.</gale:text>

<gale:text tag="default" type="creole"> For adaptation to work, an adaptive system needs
to know how to respond to user events, whether to update the [[user-model|user model]],
and how this model effects the content that is presented to the user. GALE relies on a
[[domain-model|domain model]] describing the application or course. This model is also
used to store the adaptive behavior or [[adaptation-model|adaptation model]].

One of GALE's features is a language that describes the domain and adaptation models, and
the ability to store these models in a location relative to the actual content. This
allows authors to create adaptive applications without ever knowing about a particular
GALE server. The language to create these models is [[gam|]]. Alternatively, they can also
be described in an XML format called [[gdom|GDOM]].

The [[gam|GAM]] language relies heavely on the programming language used to describe
adaptivity. Though any programming language could be used, the default is Java (1.5).
Accessing GALE's models is such a fundamental task that the language was extended with a
special syntax to access them. The result is called [[gale-code|GALE (EL)
code]].</gale:text>
