<gale:text tag="default" type="creole">An adaptive hypermedia system will at some point
return different output for different users. When [[../gale|GALE]] receives a request for
a particular concept, a process is started to [[locating-content|adaptively locate]] a
'suitable' resource, based on the [[user-model|user model]].

Depending on the type of resource, GALE may perform additional
[[modifying-resource|modifications to the resource]] itself. This happens when the
resource is an HTML, XHTML or XML file, for instance. Finally, the [[presentation]] of the
resource might depend on a particular user. Selecting a layout and/or the content of views
(portions of the screen that display information or a menu) can be completely
adaptive.</gale:text>
