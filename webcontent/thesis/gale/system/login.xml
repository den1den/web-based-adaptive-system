<gale:text tag="short" flat="true" type="creole">a component of the
[[adaptation-engine|\AE]] that manages user identities</gale:text>

<gale:text tag="long" type="creole">The {{{LoginManager}}} allows various
{{{LoginHandler}}}s to perform different types of login. There is a {{{LoginHandler}}} to
perform registration and login through forms, another handler for OpenID login, another
for Shibboleth, etc.</gale:text>

<gale:text tag="default" type="creole">The {{{LoginManager}}} is responsible for obtaining
the user's identity. When the {{{GaleServlet}}} requests the user's identity, and the
{{{LoginManager}}} is unable to obtain it without additional HTTP requests, it can have
direct control over the HTTP response. This allows the use of HTML forms to obtain the
identity, or use HTTP redirects to enable [[=http://shibboleth.internet2.edu/|Shibboleth]]
and [[=http://openid.net/|OpenID]] login methods.

Various techniques can be combined using //LoginHandlers//:
* {{{DefaultLoginHandler}}}, allows registration and login using HTML forms.
* {{{LinkLoginHandler}}}, obtains identity using specially crafted URLs.
* {{{IdPLoginHandler}}}, forwards login requests to a Shibboleth Identity Provider.
* {{{OpenIDLoginHandler}}}, use an OpenID entered in an HTML form and forward the login to
  the OpenID provider.
  
This thesis uses a GALE instance [[configuration|configured]] to use the
{{{DefaultLoginHandler}}} and the {{{OpenIDLoginHandler}}}. That is why you see the two
boxes when logging in.

Communication between the {{{LoginManager}}} and the registered //handlers// goes
something like this:

//Manager//: Does anyone have a userid?

//Handlers//: No.

//Manager//: (I can see none of the //handlers// have written anything to the user.) I'm
going to write a login page, does anyone want to add anything to it?

//DefaultLoginHandler//: I have got this basic login form.

//OpenIDLoginHandler//: I want to show this OpenID box.

//Manager//: Thanks. (Storing original request URL.) Showing the form. ... ... Here is the
HTTP request with form details. Who can do something with it?

//OpenIDLoginHandler//: That is my OpenID box! I'm taking over the HTTP response now.
(Doing OpenID stuff.) I have got a userid!

//Manager//: Redirecting to the original URL.

LoginHandlers are powerful [[extending-login|extensions]] that can add HTML to the
login page, handle registration of users, and/or use any login method including those that
require HTTP redirects.</gale:text>
