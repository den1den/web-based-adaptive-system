<gale:text tag="short" flat="true" type="creole">counting the numbers of concepts read and
still to read</gale:text>

<gale:text tag="default" type="creole" expr="${processors#known}">The
[[configuration|configuration]] links the 'count' module to the &lt;gale:count> tag. By
default the valid mime types are:
* "text/xhtml"
* "text/xml"
* "application/xml"
* "application/smil"</gale:text>
    
<gale:text tag="default;long" type="creole">The &lt;gale:count> tag counts either the
number of concepts read or the number of concepts to read. The options are:

{{{
&lt;gale:count method="done" />
}}}

or

{{{
&lt;gale:count method="todo" />
}}}
</gale:text>

<gale:text tag="default" type="creole">In some adaptive applications this information is
shown in the header. This gives the reader some impression of his progress through the
material. I could tell you that you have read about <gale:variable expr="~
int visited = CountModule.getVisitedUriCache(${.}.getUri(), gale).length;
int total = CountModule.getUriCache(${.}.getUri(), gale).length;
return (visited * 100) / total;
" />%. The count modules returns <gale:count method="done" /> (done) and <gale:count
method="todo" /> (todo). To determine if you have read a page, the {{{#visited}}}
attribute is used. Whether that really means you have seen the page is up to the author of
the adaptive application. The 'parent' relation is used to detect the boundaries of the
current application.

From now on we will display the number of concepts studied, and the number still to do in
the header menu. <gale:if expr="${_concept->(personal)#beginner}"> Since you are a
non-expert you will not be guided to all these concepts but only to 51 of them.
