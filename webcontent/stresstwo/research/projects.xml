<gale:text tag="default" type="creole">Several research projects have had a great impact
on the development of [[../aha|AHA!]] and [[../gale|GALE]]. The [[=http://nlnet.nl|NLnet]]
funded [[=http://nlnet.nl/project/aha/description.html|AHA! project]] resulted in a
standalone generic adaptation engine. The [[../aha/concept-editor|concept editor]] and
[[../aha/graph-author|Graph Author]] tools were developed to improve the authoring of
adaptive applications. In the [[=http://www.prolearn-project.org/|ProLearn]] Network of
Excellence, interaction with other systems became a vital part. One of the developments
related to AHA! was a 'MOT/LAG to AHA! compiler' [[../references?tags=Cris05|[Cris05~]]].

The [[als|Adaptive Learning Spaces project]] (ALS) focussed on integrating tools for
collaboration and adaptivity in an existing Learning Management System (LMS). It exposed
some of the flaws in AHA!'s design that prevented it from being easily integrated in such
an environment. AHA!'s architecture was changed so fundamentally, and the
[[grapple|GRAPPLE project]] would require even more changes, that the result was released
under a new name: [[../gale|GALE]].</gale:text>
