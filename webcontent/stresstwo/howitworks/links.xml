<gale:text type="creole">The links that lead to topics that are part of this thesis, can
change in color. You might remember the various colors used:
* <span style="color:#22D">blue</span>, when the link is recommended
* <span style="color:#828">purple</span>, when the link is recommended but you have
  already read its content
* <span style="color:#52A">blueish purple</span>, when the link is recommended, you have
  already read its content, but in the meantime something has changed on the page
* <span style="color:#000">black</span>, when the link is not recommended
* <span style="color:#B50">orange</span>, when the link refers to external material

Recommending links is based on properties found in the user model. I try to determine if a
concept is suitable, based on your knowledge of prerequisite concepts (explained a bit
further down). I keep track of how often you have visited concepts that were suitable.
These user model properties are used as a basis for the link colors. Some expression
determines what the CSS class of the link should be. The
<a><gale:attr-variable name="href" expr="${../thesis}.getUri().resolve(&quot;thesis.css&quot;)" />
thesis.css</a> file contains sections for the link classes 'good', 'neutral', 'bad', and
others.</gale:text>
