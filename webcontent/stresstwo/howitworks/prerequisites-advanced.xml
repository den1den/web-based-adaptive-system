<gale:text type="creole">This complex behavior for prerequisites is achieved by the
following code in the root concept of the thesis:

{{{
// knowledge definitions
#[own-knowledge]:Double
event +'if (countclick) ${#own-knowledge} = 1; else ${#own-knowledge} = 0.3;'
#knowledge:Double ='avg(new Object[] {${&lt;=(parent)#knowledge}, ${#own-knowledge}})'
#known-all:Boolean ='${#knowledge} > 0.8'
#known:Boolean ='${#own-knowledge} > 0.8'

// prerequisites
#available:Boolean ='${#known} || and(new Object[] {${=>(prereq)#known}, ${=>(prereq-all)#known-all}})'
#suitability:Boolean ='and(new Object[] {${=>(prereq)#available}, ${=>(prereq-all)#known-all}})'
}}}

{{{#own-knowledge}}} is the only persistent attribute stored in the user model that
affects the prerequisite relations. The 'countclick' boolean is true when the user
accesses the full concept (not just a part of the concept through the prerequisite box)
and the concept was suitable at that time. This has an effect on {{{#own-knowledge}}}
which in turn affects {{{#knowledge}}}, {{{#known}}} and {{{#known-all}}}.
{{{#knowledge}}} is defined as the average of the {{{#knowledge}}} of the child concepts
and the {{{#own-knowledge}}} of this concept.

A concept is considered 'available' ({{{#available}}}) if the concept is either
{{{#known}}} or all {{{prereq}}}(uisite) concepts are known and all {{{prereq-all}}}
concepts are {{{#known-all}}} (known fully). A concept is 'suitable' if all {{{prereq}}}
concepts are {{{#available}}} and all {{{prereq-all}}} concepts are {{{#known-all}}}. This
captures the prerequisite behavior explained earlier.</gale:text>
