<gale:text type="creole">When you click a link in your browser, it sends a request to
another computer called a server. Some part of that request is visible, you can see it in
your address bar. I (this thesis) am at the other end of the line, receiving the request.
The address is often called a URL or Universal Resource Locator. The URL tells me what
topic or page you want to read. Every topic has a different name.

Before I tell you anything about the topic you want to read, I first make sure I know who
you are (by making you log in). This allows me to keep track of you over time. Every time
you request a topic, it tells me something about you. At the very least I am assuming you
have read the information that I sent to you. The information I send contains many links
to other topics. Because I know what they are about, and I know what you have seen before,
I can recommend some of these links, hide other links because I think you can't understand
it yet, show or hide blocks of text, show things in a different order, etc.
