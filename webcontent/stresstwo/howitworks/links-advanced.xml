<gale:text type="creole">To determine how the user model attributes should affect the link
classes, the following expression is used:

{{{
#link.classexpr '~
    if (${#unknown}) return "unknown";
    if (!${#suitability}) return "bad";
    if (${#visited}==0) return "good";
    if (${#new-content}) return "new";
    return "neutral";
'
}}}

This expression is part of root concept in the thesis. Almost all other concepts inherit
this behavior, allowing the expression to be written once and used many times. The
{{{#visited}}} attribute is a persistent attribute that is stored in the user model. The
{{{#suitability}}} attribute is non-persistent and calculated based on knowledge of
prerequisite relations.</gale:text>
