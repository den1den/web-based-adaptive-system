<gale:text tag="default" type="creole">David Smits was born on July 15, 1980, in Brunssum
(The Netherlands). After graduating from the Romboutscollege in Brunssum he started his
study in Computer Science at the Eindhoven University of Technology in 1998 where he
obtained an M.Sc. degree in 2004.

He spent the next six years working part-time at the Eindhoven University of Technology in
various research projects on building a generic adaptive hypermedia system. The ALS and
GRAPPLE projects required cooperation with various partners, both commercial companies as
well as other universities. In 2010 he started work on his PhD thesis ‘Towards a Generic
Distributed Adaptive Hypermedia Environment’ under supervision of Paul De Bra and Mykola
Pechenizkiy.

Writing computer programs has been his hobby ever since a classmate explained BASIC when
he was 10 years old. In 1996 he won the Dutch Olympiad in Informatics (second round), in
1998 he received a scholarship from the Eindhoven Technical University and in 1999 he was
awarded the ‘Civi Aanmoedigingsprijs’ for excellent results on the propaedeutic exam in
the field of Computer Science. </gale:text>
